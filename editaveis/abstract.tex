 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
  The use of agile methodologies for software development has been
  increasing in recent years, thereby bringing out the intrinsic difficulties
  this activity which are also present in the agile methodology. One of
  difficulties that stand out and is a constant in all processes, independent
  methodology is the difficulty of planning deliveries, or releases. To reduce the
  impact of uncertainties in projects, especially those of great complexity
  and abstraction levels, have been proposed in the literature various methods and techniques,
  including the use of data analysis to make decisions and plan the future.
  This paper proposes the use of \textit {Software Analytics} for the relevance 
  analysis of \textit{issues} on open source repositories with the use of
  \textit{Page Ranking} algorithms and network centrality to support sprint planning 
  decisions and prioritizing activities.
